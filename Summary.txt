#                                                       Summary 
# This data starts by looking at the school districts and the number of total students, the schools budget, and the students grades.
# It then looks at the distinct schools within the district and the total student count, the schools budget and the students grades.
# This time it also gathers the math and reading scores that are 70 percent or higher. Then it ranks the schools based off their 
# passing scores, and outputs two dataframes, one dataframe by the highest passing scores and one by the lowest. 
# It then gathers the scores per grade year of the school as well as compares the school budget and the school size versus the grades.

#                                                     Conclusion
# The most obvious conclusion I can draw from this data set is that the type of the school has the biggest impact on the students grades. 
# One-hundred percent of the charter schools have the higher passing scores when compared to the district schools. This is likely due to 
# the fact that charter schools are not open to the general public.
# One other conclusion that can be drawn from this data set is that the budget per student seems to have no effect on the overall passing percentage,
# and the higher spending amount per student might shed light on an efficiency issue due to the size of the school.
